# NGS2017.differential.ChIP-seq.workshop
Minimal set of files to reproduce the analysis for Differential ChIP-seq analysis  workshop at the NGS2017 summer school.

Note that this set of files does not include data files. Data files can be downloaded from the following link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/lc08keg3df430ed/differential.ChIP-seq.data.tar.gz?dl=0

You will then need to unpack the archive and set the path to it in the Rmd file. By default it expects the data folder to be in the same directory as the Rmd file.
